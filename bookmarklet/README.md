2) Click the AutoApply bookmark.
3) In the overlay:
   - Fill your profile fields and click Save.
   - Click Fill now to autofill.
   - Enable Auto on changes to auto-refill on route/DOM changes.
   - Export/Import profile/settings JSON to sync between browsers.
4) Click ✕ to hide the overlay. Clicking the bookmark again will show it.
